# PolynomialRegression
As a part of my learning i coded the polynomial regression from scratch with filename named as polyregmy.py now here make sure that the input what ever you give be a small value if you give out the large values then the b0,b1,b2,b3,b4 values will be printed as NAN becaues of some memory problems if you like to go for choosing high values then make sure to do feature scaling.
Secondly i also implemented this using scikit-learn so as to learn the scikit-learn library
